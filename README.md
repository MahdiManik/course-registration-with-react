##  2. Managing State
 
The state is a way to handle data in React, In my project, I first used useStatus and I set on an empty array then destructured it into two arrays called this type name "datas" and "setDatas," and then I used "useEffect" to "fetch" the data from the fake data. and data set to "setDatas", after which I run a loop in datas to find all of the data for each element, then I utilize the data to that.
